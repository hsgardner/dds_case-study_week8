## DS6306 Course Description from Syllabus
In this course students will first be introduced to a version of the Data Science Pipeline: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, Model and Communicate and then students will spend each unit focused on a particular piece of the pipeline. Students will be introduced to the concept of “tidy” data and will spend the first few units of the course covering how import data from various sources and how to “tidy” various types and forms of data that students have imported. Students will then cover various models aimed at both classification and regression and cover concepts such as cross validation and the curse of dimensionality. Students conclude the course with a unit on deploying models and analysis as well as how to apply models to large data sets by leveraging AWS EC2 and S3. The goal of the course is to provide the student the ability to tackle a data science problem from start to finish. In addition, the course is full of interviews with industry professionals in order to provide insight into what is in demand in industry.
